I had the opportunity to speak at the New York Big Data Warehousing meetup. We had a great attendance with over 200 registrations. I co-spoke with the team at SoulCycle, and what a great group they are. In my presentation I talk about what Airflow is, and what it isn't. Some ways to avoid typical pain points, and the real power of dynamic tasks. You can grab the whole slide deck below or watch the presentation here. It was a blast and a great audience.
