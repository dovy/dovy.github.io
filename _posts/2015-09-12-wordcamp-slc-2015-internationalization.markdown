WordCamp Salt Lake City 2015 is great. Here I am minutes from presenting, so I thought I'd share my slidedeck and GitHub project I made specifically for my talk.

I'll link the video when it's fully uploaded. For the basis of this discussion I dug really deep into internationalization, and how to avoid some of the pains that some of us face.

Again, I'll add more here. For now, here are the resources you may want to take a look at.
